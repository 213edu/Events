- Drive to Mono Lake

  - Mono Lake is a majestic body of water covering about 65 square miles. It is an ancient lake, over 1 million years old -- one of the oldest lakes in North America. It has no outlet.

    Throughout its long existence, salts and minerals have washed into the lake from Eastern Sierra streams. Freshwater evaporating from the lake each year has left the salts and minerals behind so that the lake is now about 2 1/2 times as salty as the ocean and very alkaline.

  - check out [Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve](https://goo.gl/maps/uPnMj4QzkHVM2Z419)

  - [* South Tufa Area](https://goo.gl/maps/gvdUVgQKrh6pULU96) get close to check out spectacular "tufa towers," calcium-carbonate spires and knobs formed by interaction of freshwater springs and alkaline lake water

  - [Dish Bistro](https://goo.gl/maps/hwhs2n49DLsYH4CP8) has amazing burgers with well balanced flavors
  - [The Stove](https://goo.gl/maps/u2jVF6c1i6rjHNZ78) serves homestyle American plates, including breakfast favorites.

- After lunch and resting, head to [* Hot Creek Geological Site](https://goo.gl/maps/oMLQ3TAYMyNZMT2p9) to see geological activity induced steaming hot water and geysers, then drive to [Willy‚Äôs Hot Springs](https://goo.gl/maps/ApKDyLhAdQA5k4NJ7) to enjoy natural hot springs SPA. The road that leads to these two sites is a bit rough and bumpy would recommend a AWD with good tires, but I've seen many normal sedans drove in with no issues.
