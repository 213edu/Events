# Day 2

![lassen](https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/news/images/Bumpass-Hell.jpg)



Wakey Wakey! Time to submerge into high elevation nature via senic drive of HWY 89 in Lassen. We will prep breakfast and sandwiches for lunch. When we are ready we will take the path to north of the park via HWY 44. 

### Devastated Area Trail

Offering excellent views of the east side of Lassen Peak, this easy walk introduces visitors to effects of the Lassen Peak eruptions. A short ways in, the trail forks and can be followed in either direction. Wandering through pink and gray lava rocks, interpretive plaques along the trail describe the creation of the devastated area and the remnants it left behind. This short, informative trail is an excellent choice for families or those unable to take longer trails.



### King's Creek Trailhead

This three-mile loop trail provides expansive vistas, a waterfall overlook, and a climb up a creekside staircase. The first half mile passes along Lower Kings Creek Meadow. The loop then begins to the left (clockwise) along the Upper Cascades section, which steadily descends towards Kings Creek Falls. A fenced overlook provides a clear view of the 30-foot falls and is an excellent spot for a picnic. The loop then returns to the trailhead via the Cascades Foot Trail (not passable by stock), which is a steep, narrow stone staircase. Hikers may also return on the Upper Cascades Trail (stock users must use this route). Hiking boots are highly recommended for both routes as the trails are rocky and mud and snow often persists well into summer.

### Lake Helen

At the base of Lassen Peak, is a sight not to miss. This high elevation lake often has snow and ice into mid-summer, but don’t miss the turnoff. The views of Lassen Peak are unbeatable, and a picnic area to the east is a great spot to stop for lunch.

### Burney Falls

### McCloud Falls

McCloud Falls was really a series of three major waterfalls on the McCloud River – Lower Falls, Middle Falls, and Upper Falls.

The Lower Falls was really more of a wide swimming and play waterfall with a stocky 12-15ft drop into a deep and emerald green pool.

The Middle Falls featured an impressively wide drop that was said to be 50ft tall and at least twice as wide as it was tall so it’s at least 100ft wide.

The Upper Falls was kind of a chute waterfall with some interesting cascades further upstream feeding its dramatic 30ft plunge in to a bowl.
